# Stringo
Let's play with strings

## Installation
Using npm:
```bash
npm install --save stringo
```

In Node.js
```bash
const Stringo = require('stringo');
const so = new Stringo();
```

To run the tests: 
```bash
npm test
```

**Note:** You need to install the latest version of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to run the tests

## NOTICE
The documentation for stringo will be available very soon and I will try to bring out the support for web browsers too very soon!!! ðŸŽ‰
